# Stack

## What is Stack?
Stack is a data structure that model a real life stack which support two operation push and pop.<br/>
Stack operation also known as LIFO (Last in first out) and FILO (first in last out)
## When and Where do we use Stack?
Stack is used everywhere <br/>
<ul>
    <li>Undo mechanism of text editor</li>
    <li>Function stack of compiler and recusion</li>
    <li>compiler syntax analysis</li>
    <li>DFS search on graph</li>
</ul>

## Complex analysis of Stack Operation
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Operation</td>
        <td>complexity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Pop</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Search</td>
        <td>O(n)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Peeking</td>
        <td>O(1)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Stack Usage Example
Bracket syntax analysis<br/>
Tower of Hanoi analysis<br/>
